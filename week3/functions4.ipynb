Previously, we have used the accumlator pattern to count the number of lines in a file. Let’s use that same idea and just wrap it in a function definition. We’ll call it mylen to distinguish it from the real len which already exists. We actually could call it len, but that wouldn’t be a very good idea, because it would replace the original len function, and our implementation may not be a very good one.\n",
